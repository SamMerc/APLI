    "## Title\n",
    "Spectral and timing variability of magnetized neutron stars\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Magnetized neutron stars accreting from a companion star emit X-ray radiation that is strongly modulated with the spin phase. They are also variables on time scales varying from seconds to months.\n",
    "By analyzing the pulsed emission, it is possible to study the emission mechanism and its geometry in the vicinity of the neutron star, where extreme gravity and radiation conditions are present.\n",
    "By analyzing the variability on different time scales, it is possible to study how the neutron star interact with the surrounding medium to capture the material to be accreted.\n",
    "The student will be asked to familiarize with one or two X-ray facilities and their data format as well as data reduction pipelines.\n",
    "Then, specific tools used for spectral and timing analysis will be applied to the reduced data sets and results visualized using python notebooks. Note that many methods are common to several research fields and can be used beyond the high-energy-astrophysics domain.\n",
    "Even if the student will be asked to contribute to the development of parts of the analysis and visualization tools using standard software versioning, most of the technical details will be mitigated by using software containers and self-developed python packages.\n",
    "The student will be asked to read and summarize research papers and provide a written report of their work that includes a literature review. "
